# Fecal.js

Simple JavaScript library for people who frequently mistype Array methods `pop()`, `shift()` and `unshift()`.

## How to use

Simply include the `lib/fecal.js` file in your document...

```html
<script src="lib/fecal.js"></script>
```

...and it just works. Whenever you mistype the Array methods `pop()`, `shift()` or `unshift()`, everything will work as intended, no errors thrown.

Isn't it great?
